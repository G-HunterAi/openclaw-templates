## Marketing Launch Plan

### Day 1 (Landing Page Goes Live)
1. Reddit post: r/OpenClaw, r/SideHustle, r/Entrepreneur
   - Title: "I'm building pre-configured OpenClaw agent templates for real estate, fitness, e-commerce. Would you use them?"
   - Body: Problem → Solution → Link to waitlist
   - Tone: Asking for feedback, not salesy

2. X thread
   - Tag @openclaw
   - "OpenClaw is amazing but setup takes hours. What if you could deploy a lead qualifier / content engine / research agent in 5 minutes?"
   - Show mockup screenshots
   - Link to waitlist

3. Discord/ClawHub community
   - "Working on something for the community - feedback welcome"
   - Share landing page link

### Day 2-3 (Iterate Based on Feedback)
4. Update landing page with feedback
5. Add testimonials (if any early supporters)
6. A/B test headline variants

### Day 4-7 (Build Hype)
7. Share progress updates
8. "2 days until launch" countdown
9. Offer extended to waitlist only

## Technical Notes

**Current Implementation:**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No backend (form submits trigger alert)
- Mobile-responsive
- Fast load time (<1 second)

**Next Iteration:**
- Integrate email service API
- Add analytics (Google Analytics / Plausible)
- A/B testing framework
- Social proof counter (live waitlist count)

---

## Timeline

**If G Says YES:**
- 12:00 AM: Landing page built ✅
- 12:30 AM: Deploy to GitHub Pages
- 12:45 AM: Reddit validation post
- 1:00 AM: Start Template #1 (Real Estate Lead Qualifier)
- 7:00 AM: Template #1 complete + video
- Feb 14: Templates #2 and #3
- Feb 15: Launch on Gumroad + Etsy

**If G Says WAIT:**
- Keep landing page as backup
- Return to other priorities
- Revisit after Lux Life Rx / other projects complete

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** No one signs up  
**Mitigation:** Validation post first, iterate copy, pivot to different niche

**Risk:** Competition launches first  
**Mitigation:** We have 2-day lead time, move fast

**Risk:** OpenClaw ecosystem changes  
**Mitigation:** Templates are modular, can adapt quickly

---

**Status:** READY TO DEPLOY on G's approval

**Next Action:** Awaiting decision from G
